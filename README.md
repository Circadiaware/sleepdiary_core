# Sleep Diary Core Library

Documentation and code for file formats that record circadian rhythms.

## Format documentation

Third-party documentation for a variety of file formats.  These describe issues that implementors may face in practice, but which are not mentioned in the official documentation.

- [Activity Log](src/ActivityLog/)
- [Plees Tracker](src/PleesTracker/)
- [Sleep as Android](src/SleepAsAndroid/)
- [Sleepmeter](src/Sleepmeter/)
- [Spreadsheet Graph](src/SpreadsheetGraph/)
- [Spreadsheet Table](src/SpreadsheetTable/)
- [SleepChart 1.0](src/SleepChart1/)

The example code can translate these formats to and from [Standard format](src/Standard), which provides a standard interface for common functionality.

## JavaScript library

Each format includes example code for loading and saving documents in the relevant format.  They have been packaged into a JavaScript library you can use in your own projects.

To check if the project works in your browser, try the [browser-based unit tests](browser_test.html).  Then [download the library](sleepdiary-core.min.js) and check out [the library documentation](doc/).
