# Example Format

Edit this document to describe your file format.  This should include enough information for someone to use your code, or to write their own in a different programming language.

Every format has different requirements, so there aren't many specific requirements for this document.  But some things you should include are:

1. links to the code and test cases
2. links to download the program(s) that generate this format natively
3. links to user documentation
4. links to file format documentation
5. step-by-step instructions to activate any non-obvious features that are relevant to the file format
6. additional information about the file format that you would have liked to have had before you started
